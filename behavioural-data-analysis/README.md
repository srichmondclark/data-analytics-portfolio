# Behavioural Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores factors that influence reaction time using a simulated behavioural dataset.
The analysis demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing,
and regression modelling using R.

## Objectives
- Prepare and clean behavioural data for analysis
- Explore relationships between key variables
- Apply statistical methods to test hypotheses
- Communicate findings using clear visualisations

## Methods
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ANOVA
- Linear regression
- Data visualisation using ggplot2

## Key Findings
- Reaction time increased with task difficulty
- Sleep duration showed an association with faster reaction times
- Task difficulty was the strongest predictor in the regression model

## Limitations
- Dataset was simulated for learning purposes
- Results are illustrative rather than definitive

## Tools Used
- R
- RStudio
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
